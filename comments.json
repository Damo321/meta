  "01 - Guit Pulse": "Used near the beginning of Oedipus when he is answering his people's call for help. They are desperate and he is trying to rouse them into believing that he can protect them. Including a backwards guitar, Guitar Pulse captures the urgency and desperation of Oedipus' people as they seek his help. Playing under wailing and a rallying speech, we wanted to create a sense of urgency and determination, reflecting Oedipus' efforts to rouse his people into believing in him."
